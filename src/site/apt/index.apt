The Maven DDL plugin for Hibernate 5

    This plugin for Maven provides an wrapper around the SchemaExport class of 
    Hibernate 5. Using parameters it is possible to configure the plugin from 
    the POM. This plugin requires Java 8 and Maven 3.

    Starting with version 2.0.0 the plugin is provided in different variants 
    build against the most current Hibernate versions. The version of 
    Hibernate is part the artifact name. For example the 
    hibernate50-ddl-maven-plugin uses the latest version of the 5.0 branch of 
    Hibernate. It is recommended to use the plugin for the same version branch as the Hibernate
    version you project uses. 

    The goals of this plugin are described at the Goals page. The Usage page
    provides informations about how the plugin is used.

    Please note that this plugin is *not* an official Hibernate tool. It was 
    created because I needed 
    the functionality provided by this plugin for several of my own projects.
