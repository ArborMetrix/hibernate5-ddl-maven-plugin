hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin
===========================

The hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin is a simple Maven plugin for creating SQL DDL
files for JPA entities. The plugin uses Hibernates API for SchemaExport. The plugin is available from Maven Central.

Starting with version 2.0.0 the plugin is provided in different variants build
against the most current Hibernate versions. For example, 2.0.0 is available
in three variants: One build against the latest version of Hibernate 5.0 
(Hibernate 5.0 is used in Wildfly 10.1) one for the lastest version of the 5.1 branch
one for the lastest version of the 5.2 branch.

The code is available at [GitHub](http://github.com/jpdigital/hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin) at 
<http://github.com/jpdigital/hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin>. The 
[projects web site](http://jpdigital.github.com/hibernate5-maven-plugin) is also available on GitHub 
at <http://jpdigital.github.io/hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin>.

Please note that this plugin is *not* an official Hibernate tool. It was created because I needed 
the functionality provided by this plugin for several projects.
