hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin
===========================

The hibernate5-ddl-maven-plugin is a simple Maven plugin for creating SQL DDL
files for JPA entities. The plugin uses Hibernates API for SchemaExport. The
plugin is available from Maven Central.

Please note that this plugin is *not* an official Hibernate tool. It was created
because I needed the functionality provided by this plugin for several projects.
